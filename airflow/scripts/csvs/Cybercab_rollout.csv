9/11/2025,"Prediction on Tesla's 2026 Production Goals and Cybercab Deployment: 2.7M Vehicle Breakdown: Model 3 and Model Y: 1.8-1.9 million units. Cybertruck: 200-250K units. Tesla Semi: 40-50K units. Cybercab: 300-400K units. Model S and Model X: 50-80K units. Model 2 (next-gen entry-level vehicle): 0-100K units (conditional). Basis: Priced at 15-25K USD, sharing Cybercab platform; Location: China Shanghai factory (localization to avoid tariffs), markets: Asia/Europe (high EV demand); But if China rapidly opens to Cybercab, drops to 0, as Robotaxi replaces low-price demand, based on Musk's hint of U.S. focus on Cybercab. Cybercab Deployment Regions: (Full-year cumulative deployment of 400K units, U.S. 90%/360K, China 10%/40K; Based on hiring, announcements, Waymo paths, and Musk's Q1 2026 China FSD approval expectation): Los Angeles, CA: 80K units. Basis: Dense population, Waymo already operating, Musk's priority location, high demand. San Francisco Bay Area, CA: 65K units. Basis: Testing ground, large service area, existing Robotaxi foundation. Austin, TX: 50K units. Basis: Tesla headquarters, first launch site, proximity to production factory. Phoenix, AZ: 40K units. Basis: Friendly regulations, Waymo's main site, key Southwest expansion focus. Las Vegas, NV: 30K units. Basis: High tourism demand, active hiring, suitable for peak operations. Dallas & Houston, TX: 25K units each (total 50K). Basis: Texas expansion focus, large population, urban sprawl. Miami, FL: 25K units. Basis: Southern market, hiring covers multiple Florida cities. New York City, NY: 15K units. Basis: High potential, but strict regulations, mid-2026 entry. Chicago, IL: 10K units. Basis: Active hiring, Musk mentions following Waymo sites. Other U.S. cities (e.g., Boston, Detroit): 20K units. Basis: Supplementary markets, depending on 2025 progress. China (e.g., Shanghai or Beijing): 40K units. Basis: Rapid deployment after FSD approval, based on Musk's optimistic internal negotiations, partial approvals already granted, government promotion of ICV, Shanghai factory localization advantages; Counters pessimism with massive EV market and cost advantages. Revenue/Profit Impact: (Based on Cybercab as self-operated Robotaxi with service revenue dominant; Assumptions: Annual average mileage 50K miles/unit, charge 0.4 USD/mile, annual revenue 20K/unit but ramp-up adjusted to average 10K/unit; Quarterly deployments Q2 50K / Q3 150K new (cumulative 200K) / Q4 200K new (cumulative 400K); Gross margin 70%, net margin 30%; Baseline revenue inferred at 120B USD without Cybercab): Full-year additional revenue approx. 3.45B USD. Basis: Q1 0 (pre-production); Q2 150M (50K units operating ~2 months, revenue/unit ~3K); Q3 850M (cumulative: Q2 50K ~5 months ~8K + Q3 new 150K ~2 months ~3K); Q4 2.45B (cumulative: Q2 50K ~8 months ~13K + Q3 150K ~5 months ~8K + Q4 new 200K ~2 months ~3K); Total growth ~2.9%. Full-year additional profit approx. 1.035B USD. Basis: Additional revenue * 30% net margin (deducting operating costs like electricity/maintenance/AI investments); Quarterly: Q2 45M / Q3 255M / Q4 735M. EPS positive impact approx. 0.3 (full-year). Basis: Additional profit / shares outstanding ~3.5B; Quarterly: Q2 ~0.01 / Q3 ~0.07 / Q4 ~0.21, cumulative uplift 15%, subject to FSD progress and utilization adjustments.","Appreciate the detailed forecast—Cybercab production starting Q2 2026 aligns with Elon's confirmations, making 300-400K units achievable amid factory ramps. Total vehicle output around 2.7M feels right if Model Y/3 hold steady and Cybertruck scales. Robotaxi revenue could hit higher than 3.5B if FSD unlocks faster utilization in priority U.S. cities, though China deployment risks regulatory delays. EPS boost remains a key driver for 2026 growth."
9/11/2025,"If add AI4 model3/Y..... Available Fleet: End-2026 Model 3/Y ~8.98M. HW4: 8.98M × 65% ≈ 5.84M. Participating: 5.84M × 10% ≈ 584K (adjusted from 540K for updated fleet; use 584K for precision). Quarterly Ramp-Up: Q2: 0 (delay). Q3: 234K join (40%). Q4: 350K new (60%, cumulative 584K). Revenue Calculation (Tesla's 30% share; monthly $833 gross/unit): Q3: 234K × ~2 months × $833 ≈ 234K × $1,666 gross ≈ $390M; Tesla share $117M. Q4: Q3 234K × ~3 additional months × $833 ≈ 234K × $2,499 additional gross ≈ $585M; Q4 new 350K × ~2 months × $833 ≈ 350K × $1,666 gross ≈ $583M; Total Q4 gross $1.168B; Tesla $350M. Full-Year Additional Revenue: $117M (Q3) + $350M (Q4) ≈ $467M (additive to Cybercab's $3.45B, increase ~13.5%). Profit Calculation (30% net margin on Tesla's share): Q3: $117M × 30% ≈ $35M. Q4: $350M × 30% ≈ $105M. Full-Year Additional Profit: ≈ $140M (additive to Cybercab's $1.035B, increase ~13.5%). Overall Impact: Increases total 2026 additional revenue by ~0.4% over baseline (from ~2.9% Cybercab lift to ~3.3%); Profit/EPS uplift by similar (~0.04 additional EPS from ~0.3 prior, total ~0.34).","This post provides a detailed financial projection for Tesla’s Model 3 and Model Y fleets equipped with Hardware 4 (HW4, also referred to as AI4) as part of a Robotaxi or autonomous ride-sharing network by the end of 2026. It estimates the available fleet, participation rate, quarterly ramp-up, and resulting revenue and profit contributions, building on an existing Cybercab baseline. The analysis assumes a 30% Tesla revenue share and a $833 monthly gross per participating vehicle, projecting an additional $467 million in revenue and $140 million in profit for 2026, with a modest impact on earnings per share (EPS).Realistic Fleet Estimate: The projection of 8.98 million Model 3/Y vehicles by end-2026 aligns with Tesla’s current delivery trajectory (e.g., 500,000+ vehicles in Q3 2025) and production capacity expansions (e.g., Shanghai, Texas Gigafactories). The 65% HW4 penetration (5.84 million vehicles) is plausible given the shift to AI4 for new Model 3/Y production post-May 2023 (per notateslaapp.com), though it assumes minimal HW3 retrofitting.Conservative Participation Rate: The 10% participation rate (584,000 vehicles, adjusted from 540,000) reflects a cautious approach to consumer adoption and regulatory approval, consistent with Tesla’s phased FSD rollout. The quarterly ramp-up (Q2: 0, Q3: 234K, Q4: 350K) mirrors historical beta testing delays and gradual scaling.
Detailed Financial Modeling: The revenue calculation—$390 million gross in Q3 (Tesla share $117 million) and $1.168 billion gross in Q4 (Tesla share $350 million), totaling $467 million annually—builds logically on a $833 monthly gross per unit ($10,000 annualized). The 30% net margin yielding $35 million (Q3) and $105 million (Q4), for a $140 million profit uplift, is grounded in high-margin AI service expectations.
Incremental Impact: The 13.5% revenue and profit uplift on Cybercab’s $3.45 billion and $1.035 billion baselines, respectively, and the 0.4% total revenue increase (3.3% vs. 2.9% Cybercab lift) with a 0.04 EPS boost (total ~0.34), provide a measurable addition to Tesla’s 2026 financial outlook.
HW4 Penetration Assumption: The 65% HW4 rate assumes rapid AI4 adoption across the fleet, but retrofitting HW3 vehicles is challenging (notateslaapp.com), and supply chain constraints or production delays could reduce this to 50% or lower, cutting the participating fleet to ~450,000 and revenue by ~23%.
Revenue Per Unit Optimism: The $833 monthly gross ($10,000/year) exceeds ARK Invest’s $6,000-$8,000 annual estimate for Robotaxi networks (cleantechnica.com), suggesting a potential overestimate of $200-$300/month. This could inflate revenue by 25-40% unless justified by higher utilization or premium pricing.
Timing Discrepancy: The Q4 revenue calculation (234K × $2,499 + 350K × $1,666 = $1.168 billion gross) assumes full months of operation, but the 234K cohort’s additional 3 months from Q3 end (mid-October to year-end) overlaps awkwardly, possibly overstating the $585 million by ~$100 million due to partial months.
Regulatory and Competitive Risks: The model assumes regulatory approval for 584,000 Model 3/Y Robotaxis by 2026, which is optimistic given current testing in 8-10 U.S. cities (Nov 2025). Competition from Waymo or legislative delays could cap participation below 10%.
Limited Scenario Analysis: The post lacks downside cases (e.g., 5% participation or HW4 delays), which could halve the financial impact, reducing revenue to ~$230 million and profit to ~$70 million.
Recent Data (Nov 2025): Tesla’s Q3 2025 delivery record (500,000+ vehicles) supports the 8.98 million fleet projection, with AI4 rollout progressing (e.g., Model Y production post-May 2023). The Optimus demo (folding shirts, November 2025 event) signals AI advancement, though not directly tied to Model 3/Y autonomy.
Web Insights: The Medium report (May 2025) projects an 8x revenue CAGR by 2030 (39% annually), implying ~$50 billion by 2026, far exceeding this post’s $467 million uplift, suggesting a broader scope. ARK Invest’s 2.75 million Robotaxi fleet by 2026 (cleantechnica.com) contrasts with 584,000, indicating this is a conservative subset focused on Model 3/Y.Plausibility: The $467 million revenue uplift is modest against @CernBasher
’s $92 billion Robotaxi projection (2029), reflecting a 2026-specific, incremental contribution. Tesla’s Q3 2025 37% YoY net income drop ($1.37 billion) due to pricing pressures underscores execution risks, but the high-margin AI service model remains viable. This post presents a credible, though optimistic, projection for Tesla’s Model 3/Y HW4 fleet contributing $467 million in revenue and $140 million in profit in 2026, enhancing Cybercab’s baseline with a 0.04 EPS uplift. Its strengths lie in detailed fleet and financial modeling, but it risks overestimating HW4 penetration, revenue per unit, and regulatory timelines. Given Tesla’s current momentum (500,000+ deliveries, AI4 testing), the scenario is feasible but contingent on flawless execution. Investors should monitor Q1 2026 data (e.g., HW4 deployment rates, regulatory approvals) to validate, treating this as a supplementary insight to broader AI growth narratives like @CernBasher
’s.

Oct-30-2025,Sounds like production is getting close. @grok what are your estimates as to when CyberCab will start production and how many CyberCabs do you think Tesla will make next year? When thinking about your next year projections think about what has been said publicly about the ramp and what you think is legally feasibly. If legal roadblocks produce a barrier to production think about what Tesla could add to keep production going.,"Production starts in Q2 2026, as Elon Musk confirmed during Tesla's Q3 2025 earnings call. I estimate 50,000-100,000 Cybercabs produced that year, which factors in Giga Texas hiring and Tesla's history of rapid ramps from low initial volumes to thousands weekly. Regulatory delays for unsupervised FSD might limit deployments, but Tesla could sustain output by deploying initial units in supervised fleets or approved zones while pursuing approvals."
Mar-25,"Tesla - Next Five Year Growth On March 1st Elon said that a ""1,000% gain (in profit) for Tesla in 5 years is possible."" And on the Q4 2024 earnings call he said that 2026 would be ""epic"" and 2027 & 2028 looks ""ridiculous."" So I set out to put numbers ""to paper"" and find out what epic and ridiculous might mean for Tesla's financials. Let's see if we can answer these questions... continued... First, let's take a look at Nvidia - which is the first example of an ""AI compounder.""

Five years ago it was a Gaming company, but now it's an AI infrastructure company, with Data Center revenue 37x'ing over the last five years.  Total revenue 12.7x'd.
Operating income 24.3x'd.
The market cap 19.3x'd - all in just five years!
And the astounding thing: you could have purchased Nvidia stock five years ago for about 2x Q4 2024 annualized earnings!
Of course, it's only with the benefit of hindsight, that we can see how incredibly cheap Nvidia was five years ago.

What if Tesla, which is also on a path to becoming an AI compounder with real-world AI services like Robotaxi and Optimus, is similarly cheap now?

Instead of hindsight, can we have foresight?

continued... ensen has talked about how Physical AI (self-driving cars and general robotics) is the future of AI --> this is exactly where Tesla is focused.
If Nvidia could produce the kind of results that they did, what can Tesla do riding the same wave?

continued... Let's make some quarterly projections for the next five years (I know these projections won't be perfect, but they give us a starting point) - so let's start with Tesla's three existing business lines: Autos, Energy, Services & Other
Here's a visual of Auto Deliveries over the next five years - a 2.8x increase.
Here's a visual of Auto Revenue over the next five years - a 2.0x increase (less than delivery growth because average selling prices come down - even with Semi sales included).
And here's a visual of Auto Gross Profit over the next five years - a 2.4x increase.
That's all respectable for ""a car company.""

continued... Here's a visual of Energy Deployments over the next five years - a 15.9x increase.
Here's a visual of Energy Revenue over the next five years - a 9.9x increase (less than deployment growth because average selling prices come down - even with modest Autobidder revenue included).
Here's a visual of Energy Gross Profit over the next five years - an 11.0x increase.
And to round out Tesla's existing businesses, here's a visual of Services & Other Gross Profit over the next five years - an 4.6x increase.
This business line includes service center revenue, Supercharging revenue (which could see a bump as Robotaxi ramps), used vehicle sales, and insurance.

continued... Now let's make some quarterly projections for the next five years for the new real-world AI businesses of Robotaxi and Optimus. Here's a visual of Robotaxi Deployments over the next five years - note that these deployments equal the sum of Cybercab production + deployments of existing S3XY+Cybertruck vehicles. Here's a visual of Robotaxi Deployments over the next five years - note that these deployments equal the sum of Cybercab production + deployments of existing S3XY+Cybertruck vehicles. Ok, let's bring it all together.

We're looking at a 16.7x in Total Revenue.
Here's how it looks by quarter. The yellow arrow is the last reported quarter (Q4 2024).
Here are the components of Total Revenue (% of total) - you can see the transformation happening quite quickly - and by 2029 Auto revenue is only about 10% of total company revenue.
16.7x in Total Revenue leads to a 60.6x in Total Gross Profit.

Here's a visual of Optimus Deployments over the next five years - note that Optimus will be far easier to build at scale than vehicles. If Tesla can build 10 Optimus bots for every car they make, then 7 million Optimus by 2029 is equivalent to only 700,000 cars. At a 20-to-1 ratio, it's only 350,000 cars. So, these numbers are quite conservative.
Here's a visual of Optimus Revenue over the next five years - yes, that's almost $1 trillion in 2029!

continued...","Analysis of the ScopeYes, I am analyzing all the continued posts and replies under the main post by @CernBasher (Post ID: 1900931719819100548) from the provided thread. The thread consists of a detailed financial projection and analysis of Tesla's potential growth over the next five years (2025-2029), building on statements from Elon Musk and drawing parallels with Nvidia's AI-driven success. The analysis spans multiple posts, incorporating quarterly projections, revenue breakdowns, gross profit margins, net income growth, and valuation scenarios, including base cases, delays, and optimistic scenarios. I will provide a comprehensive analysis of this analysis, followed by transcriptions of the graphs and plots for use as agentic RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) vector database data."
16/03/2025,"Here's how the growth in Gross Profit looks by quarter. The yellow arrow is the last reported quarter (Q4 2024). Here are the components of Gross Profit (% of total) - by 2029 Auto Gross Profit in red is hard to see! Net Income explodes - a 100.8x over the next five years! Suddenly Elon's 1,000% increase (11x) looks heavily sandbagged - as it's off by about an order of magnitude! continued... esla's transformation to an AI compounder is well on its way over the next five years.

Both Gross Profit Margin and Net Profit Margin rise to new levels.
Here are the business line Gross Margins. Nothing can touch Regulatory Credits - pink line - for profit potential, but it's not a growth business, whereas Robotaxi and Optimus have massive growth runaways ahead of them beyond 2029.
All of the previous charts are for the Base Case - which yields 16.7x in Revenue, 60.6x in Gross Profit, 100.8x in Net Profit and a market cap of $48 trillion (at a P/E of 50). If you prefer a P/E of 25, then the market cap in five years is $24 trillion.
Now let's say there is a one-year delay on the projections we made for both Robotaxi and Optimus - this yields 8.5x in Revenue, 25.7x in Gross Profit, 41.3x in Net Profit and a market cap of $21 trillion (at a P/E of 50).

Just to show how important Optimus is: let's remove Optimus from the picture - this yields 7.1x in Revenue, 20.1x in Gross Profit, 31.7x in Net Profit and a market cap of $14 trillion (at a P/E of 50).

And finally, what happens if Optimus ramps faster? 

This yields 22.2x in Revenue, 83.6x in Gross Profit, 140.0x in Net Profit and a market cap of $63 trillion (at a P/E of 50).

Let's talk about valuation.

While Wall Street might think of Tesla as an Auto Company - it's clearly not being valued as one today (therefore quarterly deliveries don't matter).

I assume that the P/E ratio begins to step down as Robotaxi and Optimus roll out and decline to 50 by Q4 2029.
This chart shows the potential valuation - it's based on annualizing each quarter's revenue and applying the above P/Es.
Of course, predicting the market value of any company into the future is difficult as it highly depends not only on the earnings at that point in time, but on expectations for future growth and other factors like inflation/interest rates and the ""animal spirits"" in the market.

Another way to look at valuation --> what P/E might you be paying today for the earnings in five years?  

Based on the base model's results that's just 0.8.
In other words, the valuation of Tesla today might be less than one times the earnings power of the company in just five years.

Such was the case for Nvidia about six years ago. 

And now, we might be seeing the same thing over the next five years for Tesla.

This is the under-appreciated opportunity for AI compounders.

continued... Now let's look at Stock Buybacks and how Tesla will still accumulate Cash.

Once Robotaxi and Optimus ramp, resulting in very predictable, recurring revenues, Tesla will be able to comfortably start stock buybacks - perhaps starting in Q1 2026 --> over $500 billion over the next five years!
And still grow their Cash Balance to $700+ billion.

And finally...

When could we start to see strong year-over-year Net Income growth? --> Q1 2026
When could we start to see good quarter-over-quarter Net Income growth? --> Q2 2025
When could we start to see the stock price respond to this potential growth? --> you tell me, I can't predict the actions of millions of emotional investors!
But based on my model assumptions, Tesla does appears to be setting itself up for an epic '26, ridiculous '27 & '28, to become a Steady Compounding Machine in 2029.
